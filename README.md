# Forum App Mobile

This is a forum mobile app built with Flutter, which interacts with a Laravel 11 backend API using HTTP requests for operations like user registration, login, edit profile, and create, read and delete posts and comments. Users can also like or dislike posts and comments. Authentication is handled via Sanctum, and the bearer token is saved via sharedPreferences, allowing users to stay logged in.

Note: The hosted API is available until December 11, 2025. After that, it may be taken down or replaced.
